# C & C++ -programs


Welcome to my **C and C++ Programs** repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains all the C programs I have ever written, ranging from basic syntax and algorithms to advanced data structures and system-level programming.

## ðŸ“Œ About
This repository serves as a collection of my C programming journey. It includes:
- Fundamental C programs
- Data structures and algorithms implementations
- File handling and system programming
- Competitive programming solutions
- Miscellaneous C projects


## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C OR C++ compiler installed, such as **GCC**:
```sh
# Check if GCC is installed
gcc --version
```
If not installed, install it using:
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install gcc
  ```
- **Windows**: Install **MinGW** or use **WSL**.
- **MacOS**: Install via **Homebrew**:
  ```sh
  brew install gcc
  ```

### Running a Program
To compile and run a C program:
```sh
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```
Example:
```sh
gcc hello_world.c -o hello
./hello
```
